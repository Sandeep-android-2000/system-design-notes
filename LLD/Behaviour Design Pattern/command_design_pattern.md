# üí° Command Design Pattern ‚Äì Complete Breakdown for Interviews & Projects

---

## üß† Definition ‚Äì What is the Command Design Pattern?

The **Command Design Pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern** used to **encapsulate a request as an object**, allowing us to **decouple the sender (Invoker) from the receiver (Executor)**.

> In simple terms, it **turns a method call into a standalone object**, which can be stored, queued, executed later, or even undone.

---

## üß± Core Structure ‚Äì The 3 Pillars of Command Pattern

The pattern **divides your codebase into 3 key parts**, making it modular and scalable:

| Component                  | Role                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß© **Command**             | An interface (or abstract class) that declares the `execute()` and optionally `undo()` method.        |
| üéÆ **Invoker**             | Initiates the command but knows nothing about the command‚Äôs implementation. Think of it as a trigger. |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Receiver (Executor)** | The actual object that knows how to perform the operation (e.g., a Light, Document, or TV).           |

## üõ†Ô∏è Problems It Solves in Real Projects

The Command Pattern isn't just theoretical‚Äîit addresses **practical, recurring software design issues**:

### ‚ùå 1. Lack of Abstraction

Without Command Pattern, method calls are hardcoded (`object.doSomething()`), tightly coupling caller and receiver.

‚úÖ With Command Pattern, method calls become **abstract** and reusable command objects (`command.execute()`).

### üîÅ 2. No Undo/Redo Functionality

If you don't abstract actions, it's nearly impossible to support features like **undo/redo**.

‚úÖ With Command Pattern, you store commands in a **history stack** and call `undo()` easily.

### üîß 3. Difficult Code Maintenance

Mixing user actions, business logic, and system actions in the same class leads to **spaghetti code**.

‚úÖ Command Pattern promotes **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** ‚Äì each class does **one thing**.

## ü™ü Real-Life Analogy ‚Äì Remote Control

Imagine a **TV remote control**:

* When you press **"Power"**, the TV toggles power.
* You‚Äôre not directly controlling the TV logic‚Äîyou‚Äôre issuing **commands**.

| Pattern Element | Real-Life Analogy                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Command**     | Pressing a button (Power/Volume)    |
| **Invoker**     | Remote control device               |
| **Receiver**    | TV which performs the actual action |

## üíª Java Code Example ‚Äì Light Remote using Command Pattern

```java
// Command Interface
interface Command {
    void execute();   // Execute the action
    void undo();      // Optional: Undo the action
}

// Receiver (Executor)
class Light {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("\uD83D\uDCA1 Light is ON");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("\uD83D\uDCA1 Light is OFF");
    }
}

// Concrete Commands
class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    LightOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    public void execute() {
        light.turnOn();
    }

    public void undo() {
        light.turnOff();
    }
}

class LightOffCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    LightOffCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    public void execute() {
        light.turnOff();
    }

    public void undo() {
        light.turnOn();
    }
}

// Invoker
class RemoteControl {
    private Command currentCommand;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.currentCommand = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        currentCommand.execute();
    }

    public void pressUndo() {
        currentCommand.undo();
    }
}

// Client Code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Light livingRoomLight = new Light();

        Command lightOn = new LightOnCommand(livingRoomLight);
        Command lightOff = new LightOffCommand(livingRoomLight);

        RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl();

        remote.setCommand(lightOn);
        remote.pressButton();    // Light is ON

        remote.setCommand(lightOff);
        remote.pressButton();    // Light is OFF

        remote.pressUndo();      // Light is ON again
    }
}
```

## üéØ Interview Insights ‚Äì How to Explain It Concisely

> **"Command Pattern allows you to encapsulate a request as an object, promoting decoupling between the sender and the receiver. It's especially useful for undo/redo operations, task queues, and maintaining clean abstraction layers."**

### What Interviewers Ask:

* Can you implement an undo/redo system?
* How would you design a button-click system for an editor?
* What if you want to schedule or queue operations in a system?

## ‚úÖ Key Benefits

| Benefit               | Why It Matters                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decoupling**        | Caller and receiver don't depend on each other directly |
| **Undo/Redo Support** | You can maintain history and revert operations          |
| **Macro Commands**    | Combine multiple actions into a single command          |
| **Command Queuing**   | Perfect for delayed or scheduled jobs                   |
| **Easier Testing**    | Each command can be tested independently                |

## üß† Best Practices ‚Äì When and How to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When:

* You need to **abstract actions** and **decouple** them from their caller.
* You want to support **undo/redo** or **logging of operations**.
* You're implementing **command queues**, **schedulers**, or **remote control UIs**.

### ‚ùå Avoid When:

* You have very simple logic (it can feel over-engineered).
* You don't need flexibility or extensibility.

### üß© Tips:

* Maintain a `CommandHistory` stack for undo/redo.
* Use enums or method references for small/simple commands (Java 8+).
* Follow **Open-Closed Principle** ‚Äì add new commands without changing the invoker.

## üöÄ Real-World Applications

* **UI Frameworks:** Button clicks, menu items
* **Text Editors:** Undo/Redo stack
* **Banking Systems:** Transaction logging and rollback
* **Game Engines:** Replay or macro commands
* **Distributed Systems:** Command/event queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

## üßæ Final Summary for Interviews

```
Command Pattern = [Invoker] ‚Üí [Command Interface + Concrete Commands] ‚Üí [Receiver/Executor]

It solves real problems like:
‚úÖ No abstraction of actions
‚úÖ Need for undo/redo
‚úÖ Tight coupling between sender and receiver

Helps make your code extensible, testable, and scalable.
