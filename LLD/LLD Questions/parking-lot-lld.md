### Parking Lot System - Discussion & Design Analysis

#### **Overview**
The parking lot system is designed to efficiently manage parking spots, vehicle entries, ticket generation, and payment processing. It supports multiple vehicle types and incorporates scalable design principles. This document integrates insights from the provided transcript for improved clarity and structure.

### **Key Components & Responsibilities**

#### **1. Vehicle**
- Attributes: `vehicleNumber`, `vehicleType (TWO_WHEELER/FOUR_WHEELER)`
- Represents a vehicle entering the parking lot.
- Methods: 
  - `getVehicleNumber()`: Returns the vehicle's registration number.
  - `getVehicleType()`: Identifies if itâ€™s a two-wheeler or four-wheeler.

#### **2. Ticket**
- Attributes: `ticketId`, `entryTime`, `parkingSpot`, `price`
- Methods:
  - `generateTicket(Vehicle vehicle, ParkingSpot spot)`: Generates a ticket upon vehicle entry.
  - `calculatePrice()`: Computes the parking fee based on duration and type.
  
#### **3. Parking Spot** (Abstract Class)
- Attributes: `spotId`, `isEmpty`, `allowedVehicleType`
- Methods: 
  - `isAvailable()`: Checks if the spot is free.
  - `assignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle)`: Allocates a vehicle to the spot.
  - `removeVehicle()`: Frees up the spot.
- Specialized into:
  - `TwoWheelerSpot`
  - `FourWheelerSpot`

#### **4. Parking Manager** (Abstract Class)
- Manages parking allocation.
- Attributes: `List<ParkingSpot>`
- Methods:
  - `findParkingSpot()`: Finds an available spot based on the vehicle type.
  - Implemented by:
    - `TwoWheelerManager`
    - `FourWheelerManager`

#### **5. Parking Manager Factory**
- Factory class responsible for creating instances of `ParkingManager`.
- Uses **Factory Pattern** to decide which manager to instantiate based on vehicle type.

#### **6. Entrance Gate**
- Responsibilities:
  - Uses `ParkingManager` to find an available spot.
  - Generates a `Ticket` for the vehicle.

#### **7. Exit Gate**
- Responsibilities:
  - Calculates parking duration.
  - Computes the fee and processes payment.
  - Updates the spot status.

### **Design Pattern Analysis**

#### **1. Factory Pattern**
- Implemented in `ParkingManagerFactory` to return appropriate parking manager instances dynamically.
- Encapsulates object creation, promoting modularity.

#### **2. Strategy Pattern** (Enhancement)
- Different parking allocation strategies:
  - **Nearest to Entrance**
  - **Nearest to Elevator**
  - **Default Allocation**
- Implemented using a `ParkingStrategy` interface and multiple concrete strategies.

#### **3. Singleton Pattern** (Enhancement)
- `ParkingManager` could be a Singleton, ensuring a single instance manages all spots.

#### **4. Template Method Pattern**
- `ParkingSpot` serves as an abstract class defining common behaviors, with subclasses providing specific implementations.

### **Refactored Code Implementation**
```java
import java.util.*;

// Enum for Vehicle Type
enum VehicleType {
    TWO_WHEELER, FOUR_WHEELER
}

// Vehicle class
class Vehicle {
    private String vehicleNumber;
    private VehicleType vehicleType;

    public Vehicle(String vehicleNumber, VehicleType vehicleType) {
        this.vehicleNumber = vehicleNumber;
        this.vehicleType = vehicleType;
    }

    public String getVehicleNumber() {
        return vehicleNumber;
    }

    public VehicleType getVehicleType() {
        return vehicleType;
    }
}

// Ticket class
class Ticket {
    private String ticketId;
    private Date entryTime;
    private ParkingSpot parkingSpot;
    private double price;

    public Ticket(String ticketId, Date entryTime, ParkingSpot parkingSpot, double price) {
        this.ticketId = ticketId;
        this.entryTime = entryTime;
        this.parkingSpot = parkingSpot;
        this.price = price;
    }
}

// Abstract Parking Spot class
abstract class ParkingSpot {
    protected String spotId;
    protected boolean isEmpty;
    protected VehicleType allowedVehicleType;

    public boolean isAvailable() {
        return isEmpty;
    }

    public void assignVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.isEmpty = false;
    }

    public void removeVehicle() {
        this.isEmpty = true;
    }
}

class TwoWheelerSpot extends ParkingSpot {}
class FourWheelerSpot extends ParkingSpot {}

// Abstract Parking Manager
abstract class ParkingManager {
    protected List<ParkingSpot> parkingSpots;
    public abstract ParkingSpot findParkingSpot();
}

class TwoWheelerManager extends ParkingManager {}
class FourWheelerManager extends ParkingManager {}

// Factory for Parking Manager
class ParkingManagerFactory {
    public static ParkingManager getParkingManager(VehicleType type, List<ParkingSpot> spots) {
        return type == VehicleType.TWO_WHEELER ? new TwoWheelerManager() : new FourWheelerManager();
    }
}

// Entrance and Exit Gates
class EntranceGate {}
class ExitGate {}

// Main Class
public class ParkingLotSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sample Implementation
    }
}
```
