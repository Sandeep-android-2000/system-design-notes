# Object Pool Design Pattern (Beginner-Friendly)

## üß† What is Object Pool Design Pattern?

**Object Pool** is a **creational design pattern** that helps you **reuse objects** instead of creating and destroying them again and again.

- **Why?**  
  Creating an object (especially heavy ones like database connections, thread objects, etc.) can be slow and costly.
- **How?**  
  Instead of creating a new object every time, you **borrow** an existing object from a **pool** (a collection).  
  When you're done, you **return** it to the pool for others to reuse.

> Think of it like a **library**: Instead of buying a new book every time, you **borrow** a book, read it, and **return** it when done.

## üéØ Where is Object Pool Used?
- Database connections
- Thread pools (like ExecutorService in Java)
- Game development (e.g., bullets, enemies, etc.)
- Network socket connections

## üõ† How Does It Work?

1. **Check the Pool**: Look for an available object in the pool.
2. **Borrow or Create**: If available, borrow it. If not, create a new one (if the pool isn't full).
3. **Use the Object**: Do your task using the object.
4. **Return the Object**: Return it to the pool when done.

## üìù Simple Example (Java-Like Pseudocode)

```java
class ObjectPool {
    List<ReusableObject> available = new ArrayList<>();

    ReusableObject getObject() {
        if (available.isEmpty()) {
            return new ReusableObject(); // Create a new one
        } else {
            return available.remove(0); // Reuse from pool
        }
    }

    void returnObject(ReusableObject obj) {
        available.add(obj); // Return to pool
    }
}

class ReusableObject {
    // Some heavy object
}
```

**Usage:**

```java
ObjectPool pool = new ObjectPool();
ReusableObject obj1 = pool.getObject();

// use obj1

pool.returnObject(obj1); // Reuse it later
```

## ‚ö° Advantages
- Faster performance (no repeated creation/destruction)
- Saves memory
- Useful when many similar objects are needed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages
- Managing the pool correctly can be tricky
- Risk of objects becoming stale if not reset properly
