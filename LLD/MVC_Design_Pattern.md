# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern

## Overview
The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components to promote modularity, maintainability, and scalability. It is widely used in web and desktop applications.

## Components of MVC
### 1. Model
The **Model** represents the data, business logic, and rules of the application. It is responsible for retrieving, storing, and processing data.
- Encapsulates the application's data.
- Notifies the View of data changes.
- Can interact with the database.

### 2. View
The **View** is responsible for presenting data to the user. It receives updates from the Model and displays the necessary UI components.
- Displays data from the Model.
- Does not contain business logic.
- Sends user interactions to the Controller.

### 3. Controller
The **Controller** acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user input, updates the Model, and determines which View to display.
- Accepts input from the View.
- Updates the Model based on user actions.
- Selects the appropriate View to render.

## Workflow of MVC
1. The **User** interacts with the **View** (UI) by performing actions such as clicking buttons or submitting forms.
2. The **Controller** processes the user input and makes necessary updates to the **Model**.
3. The **Model** updates its data and notifies the **View** of any changes.
4. The **View** retrieves updated data from the **Model** and refreshes the UI accordingly.

## Advantages of MVC
- **Separation of Concerns**: Modular architecture makes it easier to manage and scale.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different applications.
- **Maintainability**: Code is more organized and easier to debug or update.
- **Scalability**: Supports large-scale applications by separating logic.

## Example Implementation (Java Spring Boot)
```java
@Controller
public class UserController {
    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;

    @GetMapping("/users")
    public String getUsers(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("users", userService.getAllUsers());
        return "userView";
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
The **MVC design pattern** provides a structured approach to application development, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale software applications by separating concerns into Model, View, and Controller components.
