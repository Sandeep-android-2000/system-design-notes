# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern

## Overview
The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: **Model, View, and Controller**. This separation of concerns improves code maintainability, scalability, and testability.

## Components

### 1. Model
The **Model** represents the data, business logic, and database interactions. It is responsible for handling data-related operations and ensuring data integrity.

#### Responsibilities:
- Defines the structure of data using **POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects)**.
- Manages database connections and queries.
- Implements business logic related to data.
- Notifies the **View** when data changes.

#### Example:
```java
public class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    
    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }
    
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    
    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }
}
```

### 2. View
The **View** is responsible for presenting data to the user. It acts as the user interface (UI) and displays information retrieved from the **Model**.

#### Responsibilities:
- Displays data provided by the **Model**.
- Provides an interface for user interactions.
- Updates when the **Controller** modifies the **Model**.

#### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>User Profile</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>User Profile</h1>
    <p>Name: <span id="userName"></span></p>
    <p>Email: <span id="userEmail"></span></p>
</body>
</html>
```

### 3. Controller
The **Controller** acts as an intermediary between the **Model** and the **View**. It processes user input, updates the **Model**, and determines the appropriate **View** to display.

#### Responsibilities:
- Receives user input.
- Updates the **Model** based on input.
- Communicates with the **View** to update the UI.

#### Example:
```java
public class UserController {
    private User model;
    private UserView view;
    
    public UserController(User model, UserView view) {
        this.model = model;
        this.view = view;
    }
    
    public void updateView() {
        view.printUserDetails(model.getName(), model.getEmail());
    }
}
```

## Workflow
1. **User interacts** with the **View** (e.g., submits a form).
2. The **View** sends the user action to the **Controller**.
3. The **Controller** processes the input and updates the **Model**.
4. The **Model** notifies the **View** about changes.
5. The **View** updates the UI accordingly.

## Advantages of MVC
- **Separation of Concerns**: Improves code maintainability.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable for larger applications.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different applications.
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested independently from UI.

## Conclusion
The **MVC design pattern** provides a clear structure for application development, making it a widely used pattern in frameworks like **Spring MVC, Angular, and ASP.NET MVC**. It enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability in software applications.
